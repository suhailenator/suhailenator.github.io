I'm currently a medical student at the University of Oxford, about to start my fourth year (of six). 

At the moment I don't know quite if or what I might blog about. I'm interested in Medicine/Scicence, politics/society and religon amongst other things. Check back in a few years time to see if I ever get round to posting anything.
