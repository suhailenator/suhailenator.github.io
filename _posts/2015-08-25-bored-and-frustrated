So now I really am coming to the end of my time at the centre. As I start writing this I only have two days left, before I’m off on a little break and then back to England. 

###Downtime

This has probably been one of my quieter weeks at the centre. I think at some point this week we probably reached the minimum number of students here for the summer, as a few more left for Pokot to visit their homes for a little bit. Later in the week some started arriving back having been home for a few weeks. There is only another week till school gets started. 

But as there is no school and fewer children to keep each other entertained, that also means boredom prevails more easily. There were still quite a few activities on for them during the week: football, a checkers tournament on Sunday, we also played a little chess.  On the whole though the centre felt rather empty: for a few days two of the co-directors went away on their monthly break but that meant the children often came to me instead if they had any problems, which wasn’t very often. 

Although on Wednesday they did, for the first time, get a little annoying! Having been in Kenya for 3 weeks I was hopeful of leaving without any illness, however last Wednesday thought differently. As is perhaps normal when you travel – I got a little ill, nothing too bad just a stomach ache and light fever. All was well the next day after a little bed rest and sleep! However, Wednesday was also the day the girls decided to get into fights – they came to me at least four times. At the end of their shenanigans I was a little annoyed. Though, every time after telling them, they seemed to be the best of friends just moments later, if only till the next time they came to see me.

###Doctors on Strike	

Unfortunately, I didn’t get to go to the hospitals with the Red Cross this week, as the doctors were still on strike. As of Friday - my last visit to a hospital - many of the doctors had returned, but some of the senior ones were still on strike. On Friday evening, the strike was officially called off. Talking to some people at the hospitals, they’re apparently striking not because of pay but over promotions and the speed of payment. I’m not really sure what I think about this. It is vitally important that doctors have strong representation to authorities and open avenues of communication. And, the onus is also on the government to be willing to listen and co-operate. But at the end of the day illness doesn’t wait. For 5 days, the hospitals were almost completely closed and for the 7 following days the hospitals only ran a skeleton service with nurses who returned and a few doctors who continued to work. 

For me this was very problematic. The child from the centre who had chicken pox was still in the hospital on Tuesday. At this point he was more than ready to come back, he no longer had a fever, most of his rashes were scabbing over – he was well! So I went to the hospital with the intention of bringing him back. Talking to the nurse she agreed he was ready to go, but said he’s not allowed to go without a doctor discharging him. I left it with her for a while, she said she’d try and get a doctor to see him today or if not tomorrow. 

After leaving, I talked to the guys at the centre and we decided it was keeping him in hospital was becoming too expensive, especially as we were being charged extra for the bed in the isolation ward. So, I went back to the hospital and told the nurse that we were taking him home with or without the doctor! To be fair to the nurse she was being very helpful and trying her best, and being hindered slightly by the fact that there were only 7 doctors in the biggest public hospital in Nakuru. After a little persistence and a few hours of waiting a doctor was able to see him and he was cleared for discharge and I finally brought him back. 

Talking about health, I have to mention the programme I visited on Monday - run by Ilse - for teenage mothers from the slums of Nakuru. Ilse’s organisation is called Mama Na Watato (Mother and Child) partnered with a local Kenya organisation, ICETED. This week they were running a 3-day programme with around 15 mothers, where they brought teachers in to teach them about various things. I was there on the first day where they talked mainly about health and relationships. The programme was meant to be interactive, but as is often the everyone started off rather quiet but became more active as the day went on. 

All of the mothers were younger than me and had to look after themselves and their babies, I don’t yet feel ready to look after myself. Many no longer have the support from the fathers or their own families, making their situations far from ideal. So much time was spent trying to motivate the mothers, attempting to show them they too can do things: go back into education, get jobs and move forward. They all had dreams, some wanted to be nurses, some policewomen, others singers – not things out of their reach with the right support and motivation. In the other days they had workshops on entrepreneurship and education. I was very grateful for being able to attend this 

###Hot Showers 

Hot showers are amazing and if you can’t have them hot baths are alright too. Cold baths on the other hand are not that great – but that’s what I’ve had to live with. It’s not that I haven’t been able to have a hot bath, it’s just you need to boil the water in the kettle first which I often find myself too lazy to do. A decision I quickly and repeatedly found myself regretting after starting the bath. Often at the end of the day the water runs out which means you need to flush the toilet with a bucket and go to the water tank round the back if you need any water. 

Usually in the morning it returns, occasionally however we spend another day(/s) without water which is a little bit of pain. Unfortunately, one of these days happened to be just as three new volunteers from China arrived on Saturday!

Another thing absent from the centre is washing machines, which means everyone has to hand wash their clothes. It’s a bit of pain but not really too bad, it takes me about 20-30 minutes to wash a weeks’ worth of clothes. But, I do put off washing until I really have to, I can’t say that’s too different to what I do at home or university though. This week though, when taking my clothes to be washed, some of the girls simply took them from them me and insisted on doing it for me. I’m not sure if they were very bored or just wanted to help me. I feigned an attempt to do it myself – but really I was very pleased and grateful. 

###Lake Nakuru

On my day off this week, I took a short trip to Lake Nakuru which is a 10-minute drive from the centre of town. Although I say Lake Nakuru, most of the time was spent driving around the park where there were many zebras, giraffes and waterbucks amongst other animals. The lake in the centre looked beautiful especially at some of the vantage points up high.  A particular highlight was seeing the flamingos at the lakeshore. It’s an amazing sight when they all fly together in formation! There are also a few lions roaming about in the park but unfortunately none had been sighted that day – hopefully I’ll see a few on my trip next week!

That basically bought the week to an end, I’m really not looking forward to leaving, but let’s not talk about that now.
