I’m now over half way through my stay here and I’ll repeat the old cliché, I can’t believe how fast the time has gone. I only really have another week left at the centre. Let’s hope they’re as good as the first few weeks.

###Summer Holidays

Like many others, including many of the people (if any) reading this, the children at the centre are on their summer holidays. The centre has about 60 kids in total, some as young as seven and others as old as nineteen. For a few the summer means returning to villages in Pokot, but the majority stay the centre and need entertaining! 

The centre has about 60 kids in total, ranging from about 7-8 years old all the way to 18-19 year olds. The oldest kids, (I’m not sure they’re really kids anymore) have their final exams coming up in about a month, so often spend a while revising each day. I help where I can, I’ve done a fair bit of maths, a little biology and a little physics.

The younger kids, however, are left free to indulge their desires. They manage to keep themselves entertained, often by dragging us into their games. But there are also a series of events we try and put on during the week. We’re lucky to get help from many people; in particular, Kat and Glen who last year were volunteers at the centre like me but now live in Nakuru and run lots of projects. I was meant to be running 2 sessions, but unfortunately the first session was cancelled, as the room I was going to use was being cleaned for an inspection by child services.

I remember, if somewhat vaguely, trying to make rockets using baking powder and vinegar when I was younger – so I thought it might be a fun to do the same here. I managed to find all the stuff needed from town: baking powder, vinegar and film cartridges to put everything in. After a little faffing around, we did eventually manage to get it to work, the rockets shooting up to 20 metres high by my estimation; the secret seems to be to use only a little vinegar and lots of baking powder. It was very fun, for me at least.

###Out and About

I’ve also managed to do a fair bit outside the centre this week. Julie, the director of the centre was kind enough to try and find some medical-related stuff for me to be doing. She linked with Ilse, who is running a project to try and help teenage mothers who live in the Nakuru slums, some of who have been victims of rape. Some of the things they do include health training for their babies and themselves, but they also do work to try and get them back into education or employment so they can look after themselves even if no-one else will. I also managed to get in touch with Red Cross, hopefully I’ll be visiting some hospitals with them soon. It would be nice to see some healthcare in action, although apparently the doctors are on strike this week, which I’ll get to a little later. 

###Hospitals & Health

Hospitals are wonderful places or so I tell with myself, considering the next few years of life will be spent inside them. My first hospital visit in Kenya was to take a bunch of boys for circumcision. In Pokot it happens around 14-15 and signals their transition to manhood. Although doctors in Kenya were on strike this past week, the circumcision clinic was a separate endeavour run through USAID and so people were still working there. It’s offered there free, primarily in an attempt to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDs. All was well, I sat around for a few hours while one by one they went in and had the procedure.

A few hours later, I brought them back to the centre by tuk tuk. But, for the next few weeks ‘while they heal’ pokot tradition dictates a few things; namely that they can’t be seen by a women and all the food they get has to be made and served by a man who has also been circumcised. A little odd I think, but the boys won’t have it any other way, so it’s been arranged at the centre that they have their own separate room for a while. Apparently, if in Pokot they’d have to live in a forest for a while, so maybe it isn’t so bad at the centre after all.

The next stop was the Provincial General Hospital in Nakuru, as one of the boys in the centre fell ill with a rash and fever. I wasn’t at the centre at the time – so he went to hospital without me. Once I was back at the centre, we thought it would be a good idea I go and visit as the diagnosis we got over the phone was quite unclear – apparently Measles or Chickenpox. I doubted measles because I saw the rash earlier and it looked a little like chickenpox and based on my reading measles presents differently. 

Once I got to the hospital, it was clear why there wasn’t really a diagnosis. The hospital seemed unusually quiet to me, given that it was meant to be the biggest in Nakuru. This was primarily because doctors in Kenya are on strike this week, something I knew from earlier but had forgotten, this meant the hospital was taking very few patients. As an aside, whilst I support striking in general, after seeing the healthcare infrastructure almost at a standstill, I'm not entirely convinced doctors should be striking at all, especially for a week.

I went to see him and another boy from the centre who was spending the night with him, and he seemed fairly well actually, although he was deaf and dumb which complicates finding out what’s actually wrong. But, it was suggested by someone - I’m not entirely sure who as there wasn’t anyone who could tell me anything when I was there - that he spend the night there. 
The nurse told me it was unethical for her to tell me anything as she wasn’t the doctor. This wasn’t something I particularly understood, but for now I’ll put that down to my lack of knowledge about medical ethics rather than anything else. Just for good measure, he was also given antibiotics, something which seems to be very common Kenya (and India for that matter, from my experience) and not necessarily great in the longer term.

####Hell’s Gate 

Hell’s gate isn’t really where I’d like to end, I’d be a little disappointed with the life I’d led if that ends up being the case. Fortunately, this time I was only at Hell’s Gate National Park, which is definitely a place well worth visiting!

We get one day off per week, and I chose to visit here as everyone had been telling me how nice it was. Apparently much of the scenery within the Lion King was modelled on	 the park. It didn’t dissapoint. You go into the park on foot, using a cycle or by car. I rented a cycle at the gate and began my journey, there are a few roads within the park, but there’s one main one that takes you from the gate to the other side. Although my cycle looked pretty beat up, it rode quite well!

It was quite surreal cycling along being a few metres from giraffe, and zebras amongst other animals. Gazelles seemed to be more skittish and stayed a little further away from the road. At the other side there’s a gorge that was forged about 20 years ago by an eruption of the adjacent Mount Longonot. Walking through there with my lovely guide Richard was, well, very slippery but also beautiful. There wasn’t a great deal of water as apparently a company – KenGen - has been drilling to take the water from the hot springs to create electricity. I think’s it a real shame despite the fact it makes walking through the gorge much easier as there’s less water running through the gorge. Although even the walk we took was a little treacherous – not for my mum or dad I think!

After my trip in Hell’s gate, I also spent a little time at the Lake Naivasha, which neighbours the park. On a boat ride, I once again saw lots of Hippos and birds, this time up pretty close up. When one hippo starting opening its jaws the boat driver decided it was probably a good time to move back a little. In the middle of the lake there’s an island with gazelles, wilderbeest, water buffalos, all of which I got a good look at from the boat.

On the whole a really fun day trip! The journey back on matatu was less fun, I had half a seat for 2 hours – but that didn’t dampen my spirits. There were 2 accidents on the road from Naivasha to Nakuru which meant the journey took much longer than it should have. Driving in Kenya just seems to be a little crazy!

That’s all for this week!
