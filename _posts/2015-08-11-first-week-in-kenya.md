###Arrival

As some of you may know, this summer I’m spending a month volunteering at a Children’s home (IHF – see ihfonline.org) in Nakuru, Kenya, officially as a medical intern. I thought it might be a nice idea to blog about some of my experiences here.
 
I arrived in Kenya on 1st August for my 4-week visit. Julie from the center had arranged for a taxi to pick me up, although he was left waiting a while as my flight arrived an hour late. I can’t say I was completely at ease – after all I was going to a new country (and continent) alone, living with a bunch of people (and lots of children) I’d never met before, amongst other things. I was greeted at the airport by Baba Ritchie (who lives opposite the centre) and a few of his friends, and we set off to Nakuru. On the way there we stopped at Lake Niavasha, one of the many beautiful lakes in Kenya.

At the centre, I was shown around by Julie, the center director and over the coming days would meet all the kids! Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming, all my worries were quickly put to bed. Over the weekend I got acquainted with the centre some of the volunteers and directors as well as the town, which I will be visiting frequently. I’m in charge of all things medical at the centre while I’m there – which is a little scary given how little I feel I know, but on the whole it hasn’t been too bad – treating a few cuts and bruises, handing out cough medicine and making sure others take their prescribed medicine on time. I will talk more about the centre possibly in another post, but in this post I want to talk particularly about my trip to Pokot.

###Pokot

Having been at the centre for three days, I was lucky enough to be offered the opportunity to go to Pokot. All the children in the centre are Pokot, one of the many tribes in Kenya; every so often the papers for the children needs to be updated and this required signatures and information from Chiefs and parents in the area. As well as that IHF gets donations for famine feeds, many of the people in Pokot are extremely impoverished and thus from time to time they buy food (maize wheat and animals e.g. goats and chicken) and distribute to a people. My official role would be to look after one of the girl's at the centre who suffered from Schizophrenia, we needed to make sure she took her medication. 

The Journey to Pokot was long! The main means of public transport in Kenya is the Matatu, a small van, which in England would probably fit 8 or 9 people, but as I’ve realised 13 isn’t uncommon in Kenya. Though, on the whole the first leg of the journey was fairly pleasant, the roads aren’t great but I was distracted talking to the person next to me, who was telling me about Kenya, its politics and people. We had to wait for a few hours in the market town in Marigat for the next bus. The next journey was much less pleasant, the bus was big but very overcrowded, the aisle was full with people, bags of goods, bread, suitcases, the only thing missing really was live animals.

But, a few hours and a bumpy journey later – we reached Pokot. When we got there we were greeted by a few guys from the centre, some who had now left, and others who were just in Pokot for a few days. Also, at the roadside was the girl's mother, there to greet us! She was very happy as I would be if I was seeing my family for the first time in over 2 years. We then set off to Nginyang, a short walk from the where bus stopped. It was almost sunset and to me the area looked stunning; on the way there we also bought our first goats to be given out.

This isn’t an area that is particularly touristy or visited by people not from there, but everyone was extremely welcoming and accommodating, although hearing Mzungu (which means white or foreign depending on where you are) was not uncommon. Unfortunately for our first night there wasn’t any food left, but we did manage to get some cold water. This highlights one of the major issues in the area, although Nginyang – a larger village, with a market was better off than many other areas for the people there are major problems with food and water scarcity. Unfortunately, little beyond cacti and Acacia grows in these areas, most of the people are livestock farmers. 

The next day, we set off to the villages Riongo and Chemaril to hand out some food and try and get some of the papers sorted. The villages aren’t particularly accessible there are no roads, just some dirt tracks with most people walking between the different areas. On Piki (motorbike), it took us well over an hour to get Riongo. Officially, we were visiting the area during the rainy season but all I saw was dry river beds in the place of flowing water and tributaries – getting water during this time seemed hard enough, I wonder how it might be in the dry season. 

In both these places, we had a little limited success in getting the paperwork sorted (not that I was doing much, Angus a co-director at the centre was doing most of the formal work, guided by Kapedo, a former boy at the centre who now works there and helps out). Most of the chiefs were away in Nginyang for a meeting to sort out money from a government grant. The famine feed was however much more successful, we bought and gave out some livestock and also distributed two sacks of maize wheat.

It was a real privilege to be a part of this. I was able to see and meet people from Pokot proper – all of whom were friendly despite the language barrier, and see how they work and live. All of them were also extremely grateful for the food, a real struggle for them at the moment. In Riongo, the people in the village even sang a song for us thanking us. One thing which I did find a little strange is that we were going to places where electricity hadn’t yet reached, but many men were wearing Manchester United, Arsenal or other football shirts. 

I can’t help but reflect on some of the difficulties of providing healthcare in such an environment. There are numerous barriers to access, firstly accessibility – to reach a doctor I imagine most people from a village like Riongo would need to go to Nginyang, which walking would take at least 5 hours I’m told. Riongo seemed to have a dispensary which might be useful, but I’m unsure as to whether that is well stocked and when it might be open. Beyond that, most of the people who live in the villages are extremely poor and would not be able to afford a great deal of treatment. Some things to reflect on.  

On the way back – I left earlier than the others who stayed a few days longer – I managed to stop off in Lake Baringo where I saw a number of cool things including Hippos and Crocodiles! One week in, already many unforgettable experiences!
