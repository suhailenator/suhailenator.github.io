I’ve been back in England for almost a week now, too busy until now to write the final blog about Kenya. But, in the interests of completeness I thought I should write a final one about the bittersweet last week. 

###Leaving
All good things have to come to an end. And, my time at the centre was one of those things that had to end. I’m not one to cry a lot, and I didn’t when I was leaving here (maybe I’m just heartless). But, I did feel quite sad leaving not knowing if I’d ever go back and see the kids, see friends I’d made. Having very little time off in the next 3 years makes it tricky, the longest holiday I have for the next 2 years is 2 weeks. We do get 10 weeks for our elective in the final year of medical school, which isn’t officially a holiday, but I’ll see what happens come the time. 

I hadn’t really told the kids when I was leaving till a few days before. They tried to convince me not to leave, I think they do that to all the volunteers before they leave. I would have loved to stay for longer but medical school beckoned. Fortunately, as I left there were 5 volunteers at the centre, three had arrived on the Saturday. And, two more on Monday – Nora and Alia; Nora was a returning volunteer at the centre so lots of the kids knew her. She wrote her own blog about her time at the centre (<a href="norashepard.com">) which helped me to decide applying to the IHF centre in Nakuru would be a good idea. 

Finally, on the Tuesday I said my final goodbyes and took a TukTuk to town where I caught a Matatu to Nairobi. And, so that was end of time at the centre, hopefully I’ll be back again someday!

###Maasai Mara

Often when I was out I’d ask people what they recommended I see in Kenya, more often than not they would say I should visit the Maasai Mara. It was one of the few places I’d heard of before going to Kenya, so I decided I’d spend my last few days there. You might think being one of the most visited places in Kenya and by having exorbitant entrance fees for non-residents ($80/day), the roads to the Maasai Mara would be good. Some of the roads were indeed very good, but once we got about 70km away, the roads were possibly the worst I’ve been on in Kenya, which is no easy feat. The ride made more uncomfortable by the safari van, despite having seemingly no suspension - vans like the one was in are the main means of transport around the Maasai Mara. 

I could write a lot about how amazing the place was, how we got within metres of lions, zebras and so many other animals. But, instead of doing that I think it’s easier just to post lots of photos – that way you can see how incredible it was. Although you don’t quite get the thrill of the chase.
